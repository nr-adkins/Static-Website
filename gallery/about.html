        <p>
            I chose to add the gallery of characters from Cartoon Network because it is my favorite channel to watch on TV. I have been watching this channel since I was a kid, and its shows have carried in to my adult life.

            This website is set up in a character grid. It is meant to display all characters at once, allowing the user to see my arrray of characters. There would be a search function to search through characters, if this was live/ there were more images.
